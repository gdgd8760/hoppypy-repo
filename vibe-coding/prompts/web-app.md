## 🚀 Create a Full-Stack Web App from Scratch

### For Beginners — Personal Portfolio Site

```
Build me a personal portfolio website with the following requirements:

1. Tech stack: HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
2. Design: Dark mode, modern, professional. Use a color scheme of deep navy (#0a0e17)
   with neon green (#00ff88) accents
3. Sections:
   - Hero with my name and title (use placeholder text)
   - About Me
   - Skills (with animated progress bars)
   - Projects gallery (3 placeholder cards with hover effects)
   - Contact form (frontend only)
4. Must be fully responsive (mobile-first)
5. Add smooth scroll navigation
6. Add subtle CSS animations on scroll

Please create all files and open a local preview.
```

### Intermediate — Task Manager with Local Storage

```
Create a task management web app (like a mini Todoist):

1. Tech: HTML + CSS + JavaScript, data stored in localStorage
2. Features:
   - Add, edit, delete tasks
   - Mark tasks as complete with strikethrough animation
   - Priority levels (High/Medium/Low) with color coding
   - Filter by: All / Active / Completed
   - Search bar to filter tasks
   - Task count display
   - Dark mode toggle
3. Design: Clean, rounded corners, smooth transitions
4. Add drag-and-drop to reorder tasks
5. Show a motivational message when all tasks are complete

Create all files and show me a working preview.
```

### Advanced — Real-Time Dashboard

```
Build a real-time data dashboard using Vite + React:

1. Initialize with: npx create-vite@latest ./ --template react
2. Design: Dark theme dashboard with glassmorphism cards
3. Components:
   - Sidebar navigation with icons
   - Top bar with search and notifications
   - 4 KPI cards with animated counters
   - Line chart (use a lightweight chart library)
   - Recent activity feed
   - User profile dropdown
4. Use CSS Grid for the layout
5. Generate mock data that updates every 3 seconds to simulate real-time
6. Fully responsive — sidebar collapses to icons on mobile

Set up the project and run the dev server.

## 💡 Tips for Better Results

| Tip                          | Why                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Be specific about design** | "Dark mode with neon green accents" > "make it look nice"                               |
| **List features explicitly** | Numbered lists are clearer than paragraphs                                              |
| **Mention the tech stack**   | Prevents the AI from picking something you don't want                                   |
| **Ask for a preview**        | "Run the dev server" ensures you can see results immediately                            |
| **Iterate naturally**        | After the first version, say "Make the animations smoother" or "Add a loading skeleton" |
